https://leetcode.com/problems/filter-elements-from-array/description/

Here we can see what it is called filter function.

For example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

var evenNumbers = filter(numbers, (n) => {
                                   n % 2 === 0 });
console.log(evenNumbers)
// result is [2, 4]

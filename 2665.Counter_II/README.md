The problem:
https://leetcode.com/problems/counter-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=30-days-of-javascript

1) I bumped into a method chaining (a thing from a previous problem) and I came up with solution almost (sadly) by myself, there was a syntax error
2) I should read more about arrow functions so I could understand that better
